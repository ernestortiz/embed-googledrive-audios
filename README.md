A lazy way to embed audio files from googledrive on your wordpress blog.


## == Description ==

This plugin creates a button on the tinymce editor in order to let you easily embed public audios from a googledrive account. This is possible thanks to a well known embedding hack that (currently) works.


## == Installation ==

1. Upload unzipped plugin directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.


## == Frequently Asked Questions ==

### = How to use it? =

Well, once you clicked on the tinymce button (see the screenshots, please), a popup appears where you must copy the ID or the entire active link of the audio file (you grab it from GoogleDrive) and choose the type of audio file (usually mp3); then accept to embed it clicking on the button. Nothing else.


## == Screenshots ==

1. The GD button on the tinymce editor...
2. AS simple as it looks!
